  While Loop notes
  ----------------------------------------
  
  - A "while loop" executes statements repeatedly while the condition is true
                                                  ```````````````````````````
  - A method is a construct that contains statements
  
  - This is an example of a statement:----------
                                       ________|_________
                                      |System.out.println|
                                       ------------------
  - "System.out.println" is a statement
