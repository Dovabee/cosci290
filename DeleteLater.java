/*

  Here's an array:

  int[] nums = new int[50];

  Answer the following questions:

      How many elements are in this array?
      What is the datatype of this array?
      What is the name of this array?
      Write code to assign the 5th element of this any random number.
      Based on the array above, is the following code allowed? If not, why?:

             nums[14] = 3.5;
